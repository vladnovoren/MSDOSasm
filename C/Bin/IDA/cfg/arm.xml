        <help>
          If this option is on, IDA will simplify instructions and replace
          them by clearer pseudo-instructions.
          For example,

                  mov     pc, lr

          will be replaced by
 
                  retn
        </help>
      </checkbox>
      <checkbox variable="/ida/processors/arm/@ARM_NO_PTR_DEREF"        caption="Disable pointer dereferencing">
        <help>
          If this option is on, IDA will not use =label syntax for
          pointer references.
          For example,

                        LDR     R1, =dst
                        ...
          off_0_1003C   DCD dst

          will be replaced by

                        LDR     R1, off_0_1003C
        </help>
      </checkbox>
      <checkbox variable="/ida/processors/arm/@ARM_USE_MACROS"          caption="Enable macros">
        <help>
          If this option is on, IDA will use macro instructions to simplify disassembly.
          For example,

                  MOV R7,#2
                  ADD R7,R7,#3

          will be replaced by

                  MOV R7, #5

          Apart from the ADD instruction,
          SUB, ORR and LSL instructions are supported.

          Also,

                  MVN Rx, #x

          will be replaced by

                  MOV Rx, #~x
        </help>
      </checkbox>
      <checkbox variable="/ida/processors/arm/@ARM_ARCHITECTURE_5"      caption="ARM architecture 5 or higher">
        <help>
          If this option is on, IDA will use bit 0
          of the value loaded into PC as the Thumb mode bit.
        </help>
      </checkbox>
      <checkbox variable="/ida/processors/arm/@ARM_NO_ARM_THUMB_SWITCH" caption="No automatic ARM-Thumb switch">
        <help>
          If this option is on, IDA will not propagate
          ARM or Thumb mode automatically when following jumps and calls.
        </help>
      </checkbox>
      <checkbox variable="/ida/processors/arm/@ARM_DISABLE_BL_JUMPS" caption="Disable BL jumps detection">
        <help>
          Some ARM compilers in Thumb mode use BL (branch-and-link)
          instead of B (branch) for long jumps, since BL has more range.
          By default, IDA tries to determine if BL is a jump or a call.
          You can override IDA's decision using commands in Edit/Other menu
          (Force BL call/Force BL jump).
          If your target does not use this trick, you can set this option
          and IDA will always treat BL as a call.
