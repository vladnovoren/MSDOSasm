     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     NB: Refer to BUGS.COM also.

     ? I can't execute TASMED.
      Execute OVERVIEW.COM and read section "How to install and start".

     ? My  computer hangs when I am executing external tool which uses DPMI
       (for example TLINK).
     ? I get "Reconfigure DPMI host"  error in linker messages window after
       linking. I use TLINK.
      Not  enough  memory  to  initialize  DPMI application. Solution: use
       TASMED.BAT  to execute TASMED. If it is already done, then you ought
       to  increase  "EXTLEAVE"  variable in your TASMED.BAT file (look for
       "SET  RTM="  line).  Or  try  to execute TASMED.BAT with 32-bit DPMI
       host.  It can be done by adding "-32" command line option or setting
       variable  "USE32"  to  "YES". In this case you'll need 32RTM.EXE and
       DPMI32VM.OVL in any path from your "PATH" environment variable. This
       files are included in TASM 4.0+ and BC++ 4.0+.  Another way is using
       TLINK 7.x which uses  32-bit DPMI host with TD 5.0 which is reliable
       than TD 3.1.  And the last  (and the best)  solution is to get TLINK
       3.0 from Turbo C. It is quite suitable for work, but only if you are
       not linking large programs.

     ? How to insert ASCII codes in editor? I can't insert in standard way.
      Use ASCII table (Ctrl+P) or press Alt+Shift instead of Alt.

     ? Troubles with mouse cursor when compiling in windowed DOS session.
      Add the "-NOCPUACCESS" switch to TASMED command line.

     ? Hang up occurs when exiting TASMED.
      Try latest version of  DPMI host.  TASMED is succesfully tested with
       16-bit Borland DPMI host version 1.5,  which included in  TASM 4.0+.
       Or try 32-bit DPMI host, it works too (see above how to use it).
