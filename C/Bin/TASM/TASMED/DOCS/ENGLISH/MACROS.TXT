     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         Macros  were  added  to  TASMED  to  make programming with it more
     convinient and faster.

     How can I use macros?
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         Press  Ctrl+LShift  for  macros  group 1 or Ctrl+RShift for macros
     group  2,  then  release  it  and press macro char. For example, if in
     macro group 1 'M' is customized to macro "[start]macro", then when you
     press  Ctrl+LShift,  release  it  and  press  M, you will see the word
     "macro"  typed  from the start of the line. You can also use Alt+Shift
     instead  of  Ctrl+Shift  to avoid conflicts. Setup it in "Preferences"
     dialog box.

     Control sequences in macro definition
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     B backspace     blockleft     blockright
     C comment       copyblock
     D delchar       delend        delline       delstart      delword
       down          duplicate
     E end           endselect
     G gotobookmark0 gotobookmark1 gotobookmark2 gotobookmark3 gotobookmark4
       gotobookmark5 gotobookmark6 gotobookmark7 gotobookmark8 gotobookmark9
     L left          lineselect
     M moveblock
     P pagedown      pageend       pagestart     pageup
     R right
     S selectall     setbookmark0  setbookmark1  setbookmark2  setbookmark3
       setbookmark4  setbookmark5  setbookmark6  setbookmark7  setbookmark8
       setbookmark9  start         startselect
     T textend       textstart
     U uncomment     up
     W wordleft      wordright

         All keywords above must be used in macro definition placed between
     two  square  brackets.  Place '[[' instead of '['. To insert immediate
     char  code,  place it's code in square brackets (for example: [1bh] or
     [27] to insert Esc char).
