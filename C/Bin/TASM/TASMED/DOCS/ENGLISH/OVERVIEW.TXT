      Standard disclaimer and distribution notices
      Hardware and software requirements
      General features
      How to install and start
      Files containing in distributive

     Introduction
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~
         TASMED  provides  easy-to-use,  but  powerful  workshell  to edit,
     compile, run and debug your assembly language projects.

     Standard disclaimer and distribution notices
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         TASMED  is  freeware  product  provided  on "as is" basis, without
     warranty  of any kind. The only thing I guarantee is that I'll take to
     my   consideration   all   your   wishes,   suggestions,  notices  and
     acknowledgements.
         In  this context "freeware" means that it's up to you to decide on
     what  conditions you get TASMED and what to do then with it. But there
     is two minor restrictions:
          It  is  forbidden  to  modify  or  remove  any files included to
     TASMED  distributive,  moreover,  every byte of every file included in
     this distributive is copyrighted by me.
          You may not sell or rent TASMED.
         If  these  terms  are  not  acceptable  to you, then you can't use
     TASMED and should immediately delete it from your storage devices.

     Hardware and software requirements
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         Required:
      386
      EGA
      DOS 5.0
      450KB of free memory
      600KB of free disk space to install

         Recommended:
      Pentium-100
      VGA or SVGA
      2048KB of free memory (extended or expanded)
      Some gray substance in your head (the more the better)
      Assembly knowledge (again, the more the better)

     General features
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Large files (>64KB) editing. Maximal string length is 255 symbols.
      Stream and rectangular blocks support.
      On-fly IDE customizing.
      Syntax highlighting.  TASMED can highlight  instructions, registers,
       directives, reserved words, numbers, string etc.
      Compilation and linking via external compiler and linker.
      Executing of compiled programs.
      Hanged programs can be terminated by TASMED when you press hot key.
      Debugging programs via external debugger (such as TD).
      Source  code  style  customizing  (for example: all directives upper
       letters, but all instructions lower etc.)
      Printing  programs  with  syntax highlighting. You can use different
       fonts  to highlight different semantic groups. Printers supported by
       standard print: Epson and HP LaserJet compatibles.
      Useful  incapsulated  tools:  C-style  expression calculator,  ASCII
       table and Converter/Disassembler.
      External tools supported also.
      Many  text modes, such as 80x60 and 90x30 on standard VGA, VESA text
       modes are also supported.
      Powerful editor macros.
      Symbol browser.
      Changing  style and editing of Pascal and C/C++ sources that contain
       inline assembly.
      Many other features.

     How to install and start
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Uncompress distributive with full path.
      Execute TASMED.BAT. If you get error, check the following:
        "Out of environment space"
         Increase  DOS  environment  size.  Refer  to  MS-DOS  help (try to
         execute "help command").
        "File not found"
         Modify environment variable "TASMED" in TASMED.BAT file.
        "Stub error (2003): can't find ..."
         You  need  two  files,  DPMI16BI.OVL  and  RTM.EXE in order to run
         TASMED.  You  can find these files in Borland Pascal, Borland C++,
         Borland TASM and many other Borland tools. Copy these files to any
         directory  specified  in  your "PATH" environment  variable  or to
         directory with TASMED.COM file.
      Press Alt+F5 few times (usually 20 times are enough). If you hang up
       -  your Video BIOS is buggy and you ought to add "-NOVESA" parameter
       to TASMED command line. Edit "OPTIONS" variable in TASMED.BAT file.
      Setup  path  to  your  assembler,  linker  and  debugger. TASMED was
       primarily  designed for use with Borland tools (TASM, TLINK and TD),
       but it supports Microsoft and any other tools also.
      Read the file WHATSNEW.DOC to learn more about TASMED features.
      If you successfully done all above steps, you are ready to work with
       TASMED. Good luck in assembly programming.

     Final notes
     ~~~~~~~~~~~
         So,  I  suppose  that  time has come to create some TASMED support
     sites.  If  you  can  place  TASMED  to your BBS or FTP/HTTP server to
     permit  everyone  to  take  it - send me a full information about your
     site  and  I'll  include  you to the support sites list. Refer to file
     SSITES.COM to see the preferred format of support site info.
         If  you  find any bug that is not described in file BUGS.COM you'd
     better  send  me a message with complete description of bug and how to
     reproduce it.
         Also,  as  I  said  before, if you have some interesting comments,
     suggestions, notices or just critics, drop me a couple of lines.
